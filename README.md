# 📊 SCT_DS_Task3 — Decision Tree Classifier on UCI Bank Marketing Dataset  

## 📌 Overview  
This project is part of my **SkillCraft Technology Internship (Task 03)**.  
The objective is to build a **Decision Tree Classifier** that predicts whether a customer will subscribe to a term deposit based on their **demographic and behavioral data** from the [UCI Bank Marketing Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/bank+marketing).

## 🎯 Goals  
- Perform **data preprocessing & exploratory data analysis (EDA)**.  
- Train a **baseline Decision Tree model**.  
- Apply **hyperparameter tuning (GridSearchCV)** to improve performance.  
- Evaluate the model using **Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, ROC-AUC**.  
- Visualize **decision boundaries & feature importance**.  
- Document findings with a **report and reproducible pipeline**.

## 🛠 Tech Stack  
- **Python 3.11+**  
- **Pandas, NumPy** → Data handling  
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn** → Visualization  
- **Scikit-learn** → Machine Learning (Decision Tree, Evaluation, GridSearchCV)  
- **Jupyter Notebook** → Experiments & EDA

## 🚀 Workflow  
1. **Data Ingestion & Cleaning** → Handle missing values, categorical encoding, normalization.  
2. **EDA** → Summary statistics, correlations, visual insights.  
3. **Modeling** → Train a Decision Tree classifier.  
4. **Hyperparameter Tuning** → Optimize depth, min_samples_split, criterion.  
5. **Evaluation** → Compare metrics & confusion matrix.  
6. **Interpretability** → Extract feature importance & visualize decision tree.

## ✅ Deliverables  
- Trained Decision Tree model  
- Visualizations of data insights & model performance  
- Report summarizing methodology, results, and conclusions
